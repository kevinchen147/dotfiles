# xxgj's dotfiles

> Managed by stow

## Quick Start

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/xxgj/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && make && make setup
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
make
```
